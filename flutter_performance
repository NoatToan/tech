# Briefly Explanied — How Flutter framework optimizes widget rendering?

In Flutter docs it is explained build method can be called many times by framework and it is recomended that we should only return widgets through the build method. But even we return only widgets, isn't it causing some performance issues? If build method is called 20 times in a second, does not it mean widgets will be rendered 20 times and should not it be slow? If Flutter framework optimizes rendering widgets, how?

## Answer
 Flutter framework is trying to reuse the objects as much as it can. Even the Widget Tree is changed a lot over time, Element Tree is not changed a lot same as the Widget Tree and use the same element object if the widget type is not changed.

=> Widget rebuild và sẽ dc map vào state element => performance nó tốt.
